        <h2>Understanding Diffusion in MHD</h2>
        <p>
            Diffusion equations play a crucial role in describing the behavior of various physical quantities in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). 
            These equations essentially depict the process by which particles or properties spread out over time from regions of high concentration to 
            regions of low concentration. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In MHD, several quantities undergo diffusion, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Magnetic field:** The magnetic field can diffuse through a conductor due to the random motion of charged particles. 
                This phenomenon is characterized by magnetic diffusivity. 
            </li>
            <li>**Momentum:** The momentum of a fluid can also diffuse due to viscosity, which arises from the interaction between different fluid layers. 
                This diffusion is described by the viscosity coefficient.
            </li>
            <li>**Heat:** Heat transfer in MHD can occur through both conduction and convection. Heat diffusion is represented by the thermal diffusivity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Mathematical Formulation</h2>
        <p>
            The general form of a diffusion equation can be expressed as:
        </p>
        <div>
            <pre>dφ/dt = ∇² (D ⋅ ∇φ)</pre>
        </div>
        <p>
            where:
            <li>φ (phi) represents the quantity undergoing diffusion (e.g., magnetic field, momentum, temperature).</li>
            <li>∇ (nabla) is the mathematical operator for divergence and gradient.</li>
            <li>D is the diffusion coefficient specific to the quantity being diffused.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Solving these diffusion equations in MHD problems helps us understand various phenomena, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Magnetic field penetration into plasmas or conductors.</li>
            <li>Viscous dissipation of fluid motion.</li>
            <li>Thermal transport and boundary layer formation.
        </ul>

        <h2>Further Exploration
        <p>
            By incorporating diffusion equations into MHD simulations, scientists and engineers can gain valuable insights into the behavior of 
            plasmas in various applications, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Controlled nuclear fusion research.</li>
            <li>Astrophysical studies of solar winds and stellar dynamics.</li>
            <li>Design of MHD generators and other plasma-based technologies.
