  		<h1>Galactic Dynamo Equation</h1>
  		<p> In the context of Magnetohydrodynamics we are interested in
  			solving the mean field equation (given below) for various different
  			systems to better understand them.</p>
  		<p>\(\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\nu \times \mathbf{B}) + \eta \nabla^2 \mathbf{B}\)</p>
  		<p> For the formation of galactic dynamos the toroidal and poloroidal fields couple
  			For getting to the evolution equations and finally solving them numericaly we begin by
  			removing the induction term from the mean field equation getting the diffusion equation.
  			We begin with the analytically solvable diffusion terms and write down their axial and radial
  			components of the magnetic field in cylidrical coordinates space. We assume that the magnetic
  			field component along the z direction is constant. Moreover we also assume axial symmetry to
  			obtain the two decoupled equation (written below) which we try to solve numericaly. To get to
  			the decoupled equations we have neglected the coupling between \(B_r\) and \(B_{\phi}\).</p>
  		<p>$$\frac{\partial B_r}{\partial t} = -\eta_t \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial r B_r}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{\partial^2 B_r}{\partial z^2} \right]$$</p>
      <p>\[ \frac{\partial B_\phi}{\partial t} = \eta_t \left[ \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \left( \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial (r B_\phi)}{\partial r} \right) + \frac{\partial^2 B_\phi}{\partial z^2} \right] \]</p>

      <p>We consider the derivative along the direction of z as constant as set it as following:</p>
      <p>\[ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{4h^2} \]</p>

      <h1> Numerical Solution to the above equations</h1>
      <p> For solving this equations we use Runge-Kutta 4th Order (RK4) method.
          The RK4 method is a fourth-order numerical technique used to approximate the solution of initial value problems (IVPs) for ordinary differential equations.
          Consider a general form of a first order ODE is \( \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x, y) \), with an initial condition given by \( y(x_0) = y_0 \). The RK4 method approximates the solution by taking the weighted average of four increments, where each increment is the product of the size of the interval and an estimated slope.</p>
            <p>The formula for the RK4 method is:</p>
            <p>\[ y_{n+1} = y_n + \frac{1}{6}(k_1 + 2k_2 + 2k_3 + k_4) \]</p>
            <p>where:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>\( k_1 = hf(x_n, y_n) \)</li>
                <li>\( k_2 = hf(x_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_1}{2}) \)</li>
                <li>\( k_3 = hf(x_n + \frac{h}{2}, y_n + \frac{k_2}{2}) \)</li>
                <li>\( k_4 = hf(x_n + h, y_n + k_3) \)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this problem statement we have two equations although they are not coupled we will solve all the 4 steps of the algorithm simultaneously to maintain stability.
